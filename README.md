TALKING HEAD SYNTHESIS WITH FACIAL LANDMARK GUIDANCE VIA 3D GAUSSIAN SPLATTING

## Installation

Tested on Ubuntu 18.04, CUDA 11.3, PyTorch 1.12.1
```bash
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate talkinghead
pip install "git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/pytorch3d.git"
pip install tensorflow-gpu==2.8.0
```

If encounter installation problem from the `diff-gaussian-rasterization` or `gridencoder`, please refer to [gaussian-splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting) and [torch-ngp](https://github.com/ashawkey/torch-ngp).

### Preparation

- Prepare face-parsing model and  the 3DMM model for head pose estimation.

  ```bash
  bash scripts/prepare.sh
  ```

- Download 3DMM model from [Basel Face Model 2009](https://faces.dmi.unibas.ch/bfm/main.php?nav=1-1-0&id=details):

  ```bash
  # 1. copy 01_MorphableModel.mat to data_util/face_tracking/3DMM/
  # 2. run following
  cd data_utils/face_tracking
  python convert_BFM.py
  ```

- Prepare the environment for [EasyPortrait](https://github.com/hukenovs/easyportrait):

  ```bash
  # prepare mmcv
  conda activate talkinghead
  pip install -U openmim
  mim install mmcv-full==1.7.1

  # download model weight
  cd data_utils/easyportrait
  wget "https://rndml-team-cv.obs.ru-moscow-1.hc.sbercloud.ru/datasets/easyportrait/experiments/models/fpn-fp-512.pth"
  ```



### Video Dataset
[Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1E_8W805lioIznqbkvTQHWWi5IFXUG7Er?usp=drive_link) we provide two video clips used in our experiments, which are captured from YouTube. Please respect the original content creators' rights and comply with YouTube’s copyright policies in the usage.

Other used videos can be found from [GeneFace](https://github.com/yerfor/GeneFace) and [AD-NeRF](https://github.com/YudongGuo/AD-NeRF). 


### Pre-processing Training Video

* Put training video under `data/<ID>/<ID>.mp4`.

  The video **must be 25FPS, with all frames containing the talking person**. 
  The resolution should be about 512x512, and duration about 1-5 min.

* Run script to process the video.

  ```bash
  python data_utils/process.py data/<ID>/<ID>.mp4
  ```

* Obtain Action Units
  
  Run `FeatureExtraction` in [OpenFace](https://github.com/TadasBaltrusaitis/OpenFace), rename and move the output CSV file to `data/<ID>/au.csv`.

* Generate tooth masks

  ```bash
  export PYTHONPATH=./data_utils/easyportrait 
  python ./data_utils/easyportrait/create_teeth_mask.py ./data/<ID>
  ```

### Audio Pre-process

We adopt the WavLM model for audio feature extraction, which can effectively capture linguistic and acoustic features in audio, providing support for subsequent audio-visual feature alignment

* Wavlm

  ```bash
  python wavlm-new --wav /your/audio/
  ```
### Train

```bash
# If resources are sufficient, partially parallel is available to speed up the training. See the script.
bash scripts/train_xx.sh data/<ID> output/<project_name> <GPU_ID>
```

### Test

```bash
# saved to output/<project_name>/test/ours_None/renders
python synthesize_fuse.py -S data/<ID> -M output/<project_name> --eval  
```

### Inference with Specified Audio

```bash
python synthesize_fuse.py -S data/<ID> -M output/<project_name> --use_train --audio <preprocessed_audio_feature>.npy
```
